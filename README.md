This is a collection of PHP scripts that provide a front-end to the Moab Web Services API.

Their primary purpose is interface with an LDAP server and provide user authentication.  (Something that MWS - at least in its original incarnation - lacks.)

There's also work in progress to let users automatically download the output file(s) from jobs they've submitted.
